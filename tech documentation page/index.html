                            In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.

                            In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.

            <header><b>Data Types</b></header>
                <p>Data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. When a variable is declared in C++, the compiler allocates the memory for the variable. Every data type requires different amount of memory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Data types in C++ are divided into three parts:</p>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Primitive Data Types:</b> These are the pre defined data types and can be usesd directly by declaring variable type. These are integer, floating point, character, boolean etc.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Integer:</b> Integer data types are declared by prefixing a keyword <b>int</b> with variable.</p></li>
                                <p><b>Example:</b><code> int a = 10;</code></p>
                            </ul>

                                <li><p><b>Floating Point:</b> These data types are declared by prefixing a keyword <b>float</b> with variable.</p></li>
                                <p><b>Example:</b><code> float b = 1.5;</code></p>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Character:</b> These data type variable are prefixed with keyword <b>char</b>.</p></li>
                                <p><b>Example:</b><code> char c = 'A';</code></p>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p><b>Boolean:</b> These data type variable are prefixed with keyword <b>bool</b>.</p></li>
                                <p><b>Example:</b><code> bool is_int = true;</code></p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><p><b>Derived Data types:</b>These data-types are derived from the primitive datatypes. These can be of four types namely:

            <ul>
                <li>Operators are the symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.</li>
                <li>C/C++ offers many built in operator types and they are as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Arithmetic Operators:</b> These are the operators used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %,++,–).</li>
                    <li><b>Relation Operators:</b> These operators are used for comparison of the values of two operands. Some of the relational operators are (==, >= , <= ).</li>
                    <li><b>Logical Operators:</b> Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a boolean value either true or false.</li>
                    <li><b>Bitwise Operators:</b> The Bitwise operators is used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands. The mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. can be performed at bit-level for faster processing.</li>
                    <li><b>Assignment Operators:</b> Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and right side operand of the assignment operator is a value. The value on the right side must be of the same data-type of variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will raise an error. <br>Different types of assignment operators are shown below: <br><br>
                        <b>1. “=” :</b> This is the simplest assignment operator. This operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.
                        
                            <b>Example:</b><code> a = 10;</code>

                        <b>2. "+=" :</b> This operator is combination of ‘+’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
                            
                                <b>Example: </b><code>(a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)</code>
                            
                        <b>3. "-=" :</b> This operator is combination of ‘-‘ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first subtracts the value on right from the current value of the variable on left and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
                            
                                <b>Example: </b><code>(a -= b) can be written as (a = a - b)</code>
                            
                        <b>4. "*=" :</b> This operator is combination of ‘*’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first multiplies the current value of the variable on left to the value on right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
                        
                            <b>Example: </b><code>(a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)</code>
                        
                        <b>5. "/=" :</b> This operator is combination of ‘/’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first divides the current value of the variable on left by the value on right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
                        
                            <b>Example: </b><code>(a /= b) can be written as (a = a / b)</code>
                        
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.</li>
                    <li>The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.</li>
                    <li>General form of a function is:</li>
                    <code class="code_"><b>return_type function_name([ arg1_type arg1_name, ... ]) { code }</b></code>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Function Declaration:</b>A function declaration tells the compiler about the number of parameters function takes, data-types of parameters and return type of function. </li>
                    <img class="img" src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Function-Prototype-in-c.png" alt="">
                    <li><b>Passing Parameters to function:</b>The parameters passed to function are called actual parameters. The parameters received by function are called formal parameters.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Pass by Value:</b> In this parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to function’s formal parameters and the two types of parameters are stored in different memory locations. So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in actual parameters of caller.</li>
                        <li><b>Pass by Reference:</b> Both actual and formal parameters refer to same locations, so any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in actual parameters of caller.</li>
                        <b>Example:</b>
                            <p><code class="code_"><b>#include"stdio.h"<br>void fun(int *ptr)</b><br>{<br>*ptr=30;<br>}<br><b>int main()</b><br>{<br>int x = 20; <br><b>fun(&x)</b><br>printf("x =%d", x);<br><b>return 0;<br>}</b></code></p>
                    </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>An array in C/C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored at contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array.</li>
                <li>They can be used to store collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type.</li>
                <img class="img" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Array-Declaration-In-C.png" alt="">
                <li>Advantage of arrays:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Random access of elements using array index.</li>
                    <li>Use of less line of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.</li>
                    <li>Easy access to all the elements.</li>
                    <li>Traversal through the array becomes easy using a single loop.</li>
                    <li>Sorting becomes easy as it can be accomplished by writing less line of code.</li>
